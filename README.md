# 🧠 N-Queens Problem Visualizer using Backtracking Algorithm

The **N-Queens Problem Visualizer** is a Python-based interactive project that demonstrates how the **Backtracking Algorithm** solves the classic **N-Queens problem** — placing *N* queens on an *N×N* chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

This project brings the algorithm to life by showing the step-by-step process of queen placement, conflict detection, and backtracking.
Built using **Python** and **Tkinter**, it provides a clean, animated interface to help users understand **recursion**, **constraint satisfaction**, and **search algorithms** in an engaging visual way.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nqueens-visualizer.git
   cd nqueens-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install Python (if not already installed):**

   * [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   * Make sure to add Python to PATH during installation.

3. **Run the program:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Enter the board size (N):**

   * Example: Enter `8` for the 8-Queens problem.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. The program starts with an empty *N×N* chessboard.
2. It attempts to place queens one by one in each column.
3. If a conflict arises, it **backtracks** and tries a new position.
4. This process continues until a valid configuration is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
5. The GUI highlights each move, showing both placements and removals of queens.

## 🚀 Optional Extended Description

This project emphasizes **how** the backtracking algorithm explores the search space rather than just the final result.
Users can observe each decision and backtrack visually, making the recursion concept easy to grasp.

You can further extend this project by:

* Adding **speed control** for visualization.
* Displaying **multiple solutions** automatically.
* Highlighting **conflict zones** dynamically.
* Showing **performance metrics** like recursive depth or computation time.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding of **recursion** and **backtracking algorithms**.
* Practical experience with **Python GUI development** using Tkinter.
* Insights into **problem-solving strategies** and **constraint satisfaction**.
